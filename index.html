                Chittagong is my birthplace. I lived all my life in Chittagong so,
                I love the city most. Chittagong is a tourist place most of the people
                come here for spending their vacation time with their family. If you
                want to know about my favorite place please click the link below-

            <p>
                Cox’s Bazar is a town on the southeast coast of Bangladesh. It’s known for its very long, sandy
                beachfront, stretching from Sea Beach in the north to Kolatoli Beach in the south. Aggameda Khyang
                monastery is home to bronze statues and centuries-old Buddhist manuscripts. South of town, the tropical
                rainforest of Himchari National Park has waterfalls and many birds. North, sea turtles breed on nearby
                Sonadia Island
